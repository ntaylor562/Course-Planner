TODO for Course Manager project

-Figure out GUI's and see if I can switch over to that
-Add an option to view the entire tree of courses showing their prerequisites and everything
-Create different profiles for different majors or minors
-Figure out if I can use CSULB API to read courses from the website so user doesn't have to input them manually
